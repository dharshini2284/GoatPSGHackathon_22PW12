# Fleet Management System with Traffic Negotiation for Multi-Robots

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **Fleet Management System with Traffic Negotiation for Multi-Robots**, developed for the **Goat PSG Hackathon**. The system enables real-time visualization and control of multiple autonomous robots navigating a structured environment while optimizing path planning and avoiding collisions.

## 🎯 Features
- **Interactive Visual Representation**
  - Displays vertices, lanes, and names.
  - Clickable vertices for robot spawning and task assignment.
  - Real-time robot status updates.
- **Robot Spawning & Management**
  - Users can spawn robots by clicking on a vertex.
  - Each robot has a unique identifier.
- **Navigation & Task Assignment**
  - Click a robot, then a destination vertex to assign a task.
  - Robots autonomously navigate the environment.
- **Traffic Negotiation System**
  - Avoids collisions by implementing a negotiation algorithm.
  - Supports dynamic task assignment and re-routing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Framework:** Python tkinter
- **Algorithms:** Pathfinding, Traffic Optimization
